Graphs
Graphs are the go-to data structure when you need to represent entities and the relationships between them. They consist of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, and can be used to model various real-world problems like social networks, transportation systems, and more.

HashTable
HashTables are used for fast data retrieval. They store key-value pairs and use a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. They are excellent for implementing associative arrays, database indexing, and caches.

LinkedList
LinkedLists are used when you need a dynamic and flexible way to store a sequence of elements. Each element (node) contains a value and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. They are useful for implementing other data structures like stacks, queues, and for handling frequent insertions and deletions.

Stacks and Queues
Stacks and Queues are used for managing collections of elements in a particular order. A stack follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, useful for tasks like expression evaluation and backtracking. A queue follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order, ideal for scheduling processes, and breadth-first traversal of trees and graphs.

Binary Trees
Binary Trees are hierarchical data structures with nodes that have at most two children. They are used in various applications such as representing hierarchical data, binary search trees for efficient searching and sorting, and in binary heaps for implementing priority queues.


Heap
Heaps are like binary trees but follows a different rule, all parent nodes must be greater than the child nodes, also duplicates are allowed, heaps always need to be complete at all times. Difference between heap and binary trees, is when they insert a new node, they heaps start from the bottom because we have to make it complete as always while BST from the top


Recursions are really powerful to merge sort and quick sort
